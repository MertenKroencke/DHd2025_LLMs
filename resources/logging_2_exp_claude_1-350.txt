The phrase "zum Spott uns luden" (invited us for mockery) further emphasizes feelings of rejection and isolation, which are part of SADNESS in the sense of the annotation. The stanza also contains markers for FEAR, as evidenced by the image of an "aufgescheuchtes Heer von fremden Vögeln" (startled army of foreign birds) being chased away, which suggests a constant state of alarm and vulnerability.
